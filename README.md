# Surfs up!

## Challenge Assignment 9:

Challenge assignment was to analyze the dataset to find a few key aspects of Oahu’s seasonal weather data as the investors want to ensure you’ve hit all of the key points before opening the surf shop.  The focus is to ensure there are enough customers between seasons to sustain business year-round.

### GOALS

- Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
- Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
- Compare your findings between the month of June and December.
- Make 2 or 3 recommendations for further analysis.
- Share your findings in the Jupyter Notebook.

### Findings

Overall, we feel extremely confident the surf shop will be able to sustain business year-round.  In completeing this analysis, we examined the peak month of June to December weather station readings to conclude that there is not a significant difference in weather patterns to impact the amount of customers.  The average temperature in December was only 4 degrees cooler than june in Oahu.  With most other locations in the country dropping sharply in temperature, we predict a potential influx in surfing business during the winter months as customers will be traveling to escape their cold locations and vacation in sunny Hawaii.  In addition, the max difference in temperature was only 2 degrees different between summer and winter (85 in June, 83 in December), and the minimum temperature in December was 56 degrees.  The consistency of weather patterns solidifies that surfing in Oahu is all season long!

 - The average temperature in Oahu for December is 71 degrees
 - The average temperature in Oahu for December is 75 degrees.
 - December temperature range 56 - 83 degrees.
 - June temperature range 64 - 85 degrees.
 
 ### Further Analysis Recommendations
 
While the data we analyzed supported the year-long customer retention for our surf shop, we realized additional anlaysis could be leveraged for further insight:

 - Compare Oahu data with other primary surfing hot spots for summer and winter months.
 - Compare data in the spring to determine rainfall as that may have a larger impact on customers.
 - Understand local issues (hurricanes - volcanoes) and pull in data for those months to examine. 
 - Analyze additional surf shop locations in Oahu to check distance and customer success.
  
  
 ### Data Summary
  - June included 1,574 precipitation readings and 1,700 temperature readings.
  - December included 1,405 precipitation readings and 1,517 temperature readings.
